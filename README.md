The rules of a game should be balanced. This means if the game is too difficult, people will not play it. If the game is too easy, people will not find it challenging enough to
spend time on it.

Game designers spend a lot of time trying to get the balance of the game right.

Fuel is reduced while moving the car, but it can be increased by getting a fuel tank.

A good game is also adaptive - normally their difficulty level keeps increasing as the player plays the game.

## How do you think is our car racing game adaptive?

By adding collisions between both cars and the obstacles.

A good gameplay has some elements of chance and some elements of skill involved.

## What do you think are the elements of chance in this game?

The appearance of fuel tanks, obstacles, and other player’s cars are completely random. So whether the fuel increases or a collision occurs, these involve the elements of
chance.

## What are the elements of skill in this game?

The skill of the player in quickly maneuvering their car away from the other player’s car and obstacles and grab all the fuel tanks on the way.

Another very good characteristic of games is that they give immediate feedback to the player on how they are doing.

## How is this being done in our game?


1) The player gets a score depending on the power coin they collect.
2) The player gets a rank on crossing the finish line.
3) The player loses life on collision.
4) The player loses life when they run out of fuel.
